# pingpong-game
This is a mini python game using Turtle. It is a two-player game that you can run on your desktop. Lastly, this was created for a school assignment.

Here are the mechanics of the game:
    #To play, control the "right" or "black" paddle by using the "UP" and "DOWN" arrow keys.
    #On the other hand, control the "left" or the "red" paddle by using the "W" key to move up and "S" key to move down.
    #If a player fails to catch the ball, their opponent will earn a point.

Logic/Constraints created for the game:
    #The movement of the ball will increase each time the players catch it, in order to enhance the difficulty and intensity of the game.
    #Both the paddles and the ball will be restricted from crossing the boundaries of the court, except at their respective bases to better identify the scores.
